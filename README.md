# Digg Daily RSS Feed & Chrome Extension

![Digg Daily RSS Logo](images/digg-daily-rss-logo.jpeg)

> 📻 Listen to Digg Daily in the podcast app of your choice — no browser required.

## What This Project Does

**This project does NOT create the AI audio content.** Digg Daily is an AI-generated news digest produced and hosted by [Digg.com](https://digg.com). We simply provide a **podcast-friendly RSS feed wrapper** so you can listen to it on the go in your favorite podcast player, rather than being tied to the Digg website.

This project provides two ways to access Digg Daily outside the website:

1. **Podcast RSS Feed** - Subscribe in any podcast app (Apple Podcasts, Pocket Casts, Overcast, etc.)
2. **Chrome Extension** - Quick one-click access to today's episode from your browser

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is an **unofficial, community-created** project. We are **not affiliated with Digg.com**. All audio content is created, owned, and hosted by Digg. This tool simply wraps their publicly available audio files into a standard podcast RSS format for easier consumption.
>
> The [/diggdaily community](https://digg.com/diggdaily) is curated by [@roland](https://digg.com/@roland). This RSS feed project is created by [@pixelnated](https://digg.com/@pixelnated).

### How It Works

2. Constructs direct audio URLs from the CloudFront CDN
3. Generates a podcast-compatible RSS feed
4. Publishes to GitHub Pages

## ❓ FAQ

### Why only "official" Digg Daily?

The `/diggdaily` community has two types of posts:
- **Official Digg Daily** - AI-generated, hosted on Google Drive
- **Homemade Digg Recap** - Human-read by @roland, usually on Spotify

This tool defaults to official-only because:
1. Consistent audio format (Google Drive MP3)
2. Same AI hosts each day
3. What most people mean by "Digg Daily"

Use `--all` flag to include both.

### Can I share this feed?

Yes! Once deployed to GitHub Pages, anyone can subscribe to your feed URL.

### Audio not playing in podcast app?

Some apps have issues with Google Drive redirect URLs. If your app doesn't work:
1. Try a different podcast app
2. Use the Chrome extension for direct playback
3. Download episodes manually

### How do I change the update schedule?

Edit `.github/workflows/update-feed.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 14 * * *'  # 2 PM UTC daily
```

See [cron syntax](https://crontab.guru/) for help.
